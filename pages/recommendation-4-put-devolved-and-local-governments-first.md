###### Recommendation 4
# Put devolved and local governments first by prioritising collaboration between central, devolved and local government

> As an employee in local government, the lack of money is what keeps most council officers up at night. Councils are having to make impossible decisions about what to prioritise in the present, resulting in deteriorating services in the short run, and chronic underinvestment now will mean even greater pressure on services in the future that we are unprepared for.

According to the [Local Government Authority](https://www.local.gov.uk/about/news/section-114-fear-almost-1-5-council-leaders-and-chief-executives-after-cashless-autumn), political spending decisions mean that 1 in 5 of England’s 317 councils are at risk of bankruptcy while almost half fear they will not have enough money for the delivery of essential services in 2024-5.

While the Scottish and Welsh governments have prioritised public sector collaboration, the Institute for Government notes that England has “[pursued more top-down techniques](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/report/devolved-public-services)”; digital reform has followed suit, often taking a Whitehall-first approach, focussed on transactional delivery rather than whole service renewal. This is inline with the overall trend to centralisation and disempowerment documented in the Brown Commision report [A New Future](https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Commission-on-the-UKs-Future.pdf), which advocates for redistributing resource and decision-making capability to devolved and local administrations.

The tendency to cascade means that service delivery can get stuck in a number of ways and there is not sufficient understanding of what must happen at national, regional local scale. Making collaboration work is not On the one hand, the NHS is an agglomeration of hundreds of differently shaped and sized organisations that deliver thousands of services to millions of people. It is the largest employer in Europe. On the other, someone working in local government described the problem thus:

> Digital services at a local authority level are usually not at a scale that means the volumes involved stack up relative to the costs of digitising and optimising the process. This means that every council is solving common service issues or opportunities … and there is a lack of cohort political mandate, will and coordination to pool costs.

One contributor commented that “central government does not understand how the rest of the public sector operates in terms of digital/data”, which in turn means that cross-cutting initiatives such as Crown Commercial Services frameworks do not reflect how procurement works outside of Whitehall, while dev often have to compete against one another for innovation funding, rather than being able to collaborate to share learning and achieve economies of scale.

Coordination between organisations and governments of different shapes and sizes is not just a technical matter; it requires active facilitation and relationship building, and appreciation and respect for different contexts, resource levels and user needs.

While there are many organic and self-organised collaboration networks across local government, the lack of formal incentives and support structures means that many of the gains and efficiencies expected to be delivered by digital transformation have not been experienced by the resource-strapped local authorities and delivery bodies who need them most.

Another addressed the fact that some issues – such as legacy technologies – need to be addressed through nationally coordinated plans, delivered locally. There is also little capacity to deliver joined-up journeys for service users who need to move between national and local digital services, and – while initiatives such as Local Gov Drupal and the London Library Consortium show what could be possible – these approaches are not brought to bear on the most significant and resource intensive challenges, such as social care.

Getting local delivery right is essential for building strong foundations and delivering reformed public services at scale but there is little resource allocated to this and much duplication. In addition to improved skills and, as discussed below, improved standards and infrastructure for collaboration, the creation of more regional  “Offices of Technology and Innovation” modelled on the London Office of Technology Innovation should be created to practically support, develop, and facilitate collaboration across local governments. These offices should be designed, run and accountable to the regions themselves, and support local efforts for better digital and data operations. Functions might include providing “sandboxes” for local authorities to work with regulators to test new models and build confidence in data portability and access.
